* consider doing close async (i.e. NFS can have slow close AFAIK)

* return possible error from close (i.e. NFS too)

* implement win32 support

o [DONE] resolve TODO with open flags (i.e. at least O_CREAT and O_TRUNC)

o [DONE] cleanly export either open flag constants or maybe wrap open and
   parse options into int flags

* maybe clean up return values (i.e. {ok, Value} versus {error,
   _} and just value)

o [DONE] using strerror to stringify errno values seems like stupid
   idea. Need EPERM to become eperm, just like with erlang's file
   driver

o [DONE] use large file io on linux/i386
